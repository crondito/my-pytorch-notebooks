### **Summary of Class 15: Attention Mechanisms and Advanced NLP Models**  

#### **Class Overview**  
This class dives deep into **attention mechanisms** and their transformative role in modern deep learning, particularly in **natural language processing (NLP)**. Key topics include:  
1. **Attention Mechanisms**: How they dynamically focus on relevant parts of input data.  
2. **Transformer Architecture**: Replacing RNNs with self-attention for parallel processing.  
3. **Practical Applications**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., Hugging Face’s Transformers) for tasks like machine translation.

### **Key Concepts**  

#### **1. Attention Mechanisms**  
- **Purpose**: Allow models to weigh the importance of different input elements (e.g., words in a sentence or regions in an image).  
- **Types**:  
  - **Source-Target Attention**: Links encoder and decoder in seq2seq models (e.g., "学校" → "school").  
  - **Self-Attention**: Captures relationships within a single sequence (e.g., "人工" and "知能" in "人工知能").  
- **Visualization**:  
  ```python  
  # Simplified attention calculation  
  attention_weights = softmax(Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k))  # Q: Query, K: Key, d_k: dimension  
  output = attention_weights @ V  # V: Value  
  ```  

#### **2. Transformer Models**  
- **Core Idea**: Replace sequential RNNs with **parallelizable self-attention** layers.  
- **Components**:  
  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention heads to capture diverse relationships.  
  - **Positional Encoding**: Injects timing info since Transformers lack inherent sequence awareness.  
- **Advantage**: Faster training and better handling of long-range dependencies than RNNs.  

#### **3. Practical Implementation**  
- **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models**:  
  - Use Hugging Face’s `Transformer` models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for tasks like translation.  
  - Example workflow:  
    ```python  
    from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification  
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')  
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')  
    # Fine-tune on custom data  
    ```

### **Homework Assignments**  

#### **1. Transformer-Based Translation (Due: July 26, 23:59)**  
- **Task**: Fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer (e.g., MarianMT) for Japanese-to-English translation.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Preprocess parallel text data (Japanese → English).  
  2. Load a pre-trained model and adapt it using `Hugging Face` libraries.  
  3. Compare results with/without fine-tuning.  
- **Deliverables**: Jupyter Notebook with code, translation examples, and analysis.  

#### **2. Final Project: Speech Style Evaluation (Due: August 16, 23:59)**  
- **Task**: Classify 25 speech style traits (e.g., fluency, clarity) from audio clips.  
- **Model Ideas**:  
  - Hybrid **CNN-LSTM** with attention.  
  - **Data Augmentation**: Add noise, pitch shifts to audio.  
  - **Feature Engineering**: Combine MFCCs with prosodic features (pitch, energy).  
- **Submission**: Notebook with model code, evaluation metrics, and a diagnostic chart of your own speech.

### **Additional Notes**  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Hugging Face**: For pre-trained NLP models.  
  - **Librosa**: Advanced audio feature extraction.  
- **Challenge**: Balancing model complexity and computational limits (especially on Colab’s free GPU).  
- **Ethical Consideration**: Ensure audio data usage respects privacy norms.  

This class bridges **theory** (attention mechanisms) and **cutting-edge practice** (Transformers), equipping students to implement state-of-the-art NLP and audio processing models.
